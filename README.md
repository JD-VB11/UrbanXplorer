<h1 align="center">UrbanXplorer</h1>

<p>How can an urban planner leverage NASA data to solve problems in the urban structure of the Dominican Republic?</p>
<hr>
<h2>SUMMARY</h2>
<p>We introduce UrbanXplorer, a project which goal is to provide urban planners, engineers, and local authorities with an accessible tool, based on scientific data, that supports sustainable planning and urban resilience in the Dominican Republic. In pursuit of achiving this we have developed an interactive map that integrates geospatial information from NASA sources and other open databases. Our map gives insights of critical aspects of the urban environment, such as: high-population-density zones, to plan for more balanced growth, areas needing new power plants or basic services, optimizing resource distribution, sectors with sewage system issues or environmental risk, facilitating decision-making for infrastructure projects using NASA data.

<h2>PROJECT DETAILS</h2>

<H1>HOW DOES IT WORK</H1>
<p>UrbanXplorer is a web platform designed to support sustainable urban planning and decision-making in the Dominican Republic through the use of scientific and geospatial data. The website features an interactive map that integrates information from NASA’s open datasets and local sources, allowing users to explore critical aspects of the urban environment. It highlights overpopulated areas, zones with low light intensity that indicate the need for new power plants, deforested regions, and protected natural areas, providing valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers. Beyond the map, UrbanXplorer also includes a built-in chatbot that helps users interpret the data and find relevant information quickly, as well as interactive indicators that synthesize complex datasets into clear and actionable insights. Together, these tools make UrbanXplorer an accessible and intelligent platform that empowers local authorities, engineers, and planners to design more resilient, balanced, and sustainable cities.

<h1>WHAT FACTORS WE CONSIDERED?</h1>
<p>While developing UrbanXplorer, we carefully selected factors that directly influence urban sustainability and resilience in the Dominican Republic. Our goal was to provide a holistic understanding of the country’s urban dynamics by combining environmental, social, and infrastructural data. The main factors we considered include:

Population density: to identify overpopulated zones and areas that require more balanced urban development.
Energy accessibility: using light intensity data to detect regions with limited power coverage and potential locations for new power plants.
Environmental conditions: such as deforested areas and protected zones, to ensure that urban expansion aligns with environmental conservation efforts.
Infrastructure and basic services: including sewage systems and road connectivity, to pinpoint communities lacking essential urban infrastructure.
Risk and resilience: considering flood-prone or environmentally sensitive areas where development must be carefully planned.

By integrating these factors into a unified web platform, UrbanXplorer allows decision-makers to visualize complex urban challenges, prioritize interventions, and promote sustainable growth supported by reliable scientific data.
</p>
<h1>BENEFITS</h1>
<p>Using UrbanXplorer offers significant advantages for urban planners, engineers, and policymakers by turning complex geospatial data into clear, actionable insights. Through its interactive map, indicators, and built-in chatbot, UrbanXplorer makes scientific data accessible and easy to interpret, even for non-technical users. Moreover, by revealing high-risk or underdeveloped zones, it supports urban resilience and disaster preparedness. Overall, UrbanXplorer empowers decision-makers to plan smarter, greener, and more balanced cities while fostering transparency and sustainable growth.
